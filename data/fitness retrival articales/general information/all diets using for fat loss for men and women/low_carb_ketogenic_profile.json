        "purpose_overview": {
            "goal": "Facilitate fat loss, improve metabolic flexibility, and stabilize blood sugar through a significant reduction in carbohydrate intake.",
            "approach": "Replace most dietary carbohydrates with fats as the primary energy source. When carbs are very low (<50 g/day), the body shifts into ketosis, producing ketone bodies (\u03b2-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate) as alternative fuels.",
            "best_for": "Individuals struggling with appetite control, insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, or those preferring higher-fat foods. Also used in certain medical contexts (e.g., epilepsy).",
            "why_it_works": "Reduces insulin levels, enhances satiety, naturally lowers calorie intake, and promotes reliance on fat oxidation (Westman et al., 2007; Hallberg et al., 2018)."

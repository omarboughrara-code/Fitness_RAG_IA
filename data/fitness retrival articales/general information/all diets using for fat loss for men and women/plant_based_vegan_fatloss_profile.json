            "goal": "Achieve sustainable fat loss while maintaining muscle mass and supporting overall health through a 100% plant-based dietary approach.",
            "approach": "Focus on whole, minimally processed plant foods \u2014 legumes, grains, vegetables, fruits, nuts, and seeds \u2014 combined with caloric restriction (\u224815\u201325% below TDEE). Prioritize high protein, fiber-rich foods to optimize satiety and muscle preservation.",

                "Individuals seeking fat loss with ethical, environmental, or health motivations",

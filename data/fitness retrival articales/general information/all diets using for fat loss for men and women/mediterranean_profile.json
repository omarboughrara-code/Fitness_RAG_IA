            "approach": "Base meals on whole, plant-forward foods, olive oil as the main fat, moderate fish/poultry, minimal red/processed meat, and calorie control (\u224815\u201325% below TDEE).",
            "best_for": [
                "Individuals seeking fat loss with high dietary adherence",

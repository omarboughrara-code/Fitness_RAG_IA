        "purpose_overview": {
            "goal": "Facilitate fat loss or weight management by reducing dietary fat intake, thereby lowering overall calorie density and shifting macronutrient emphasis toward carbohydrates and protein.",
            "approach": "Limit total fat intake to ~20\u201330% of daily calories (sometimes <20% in stricter protocols) while maintaining adequate protein and sufficient carbohydrate for training fuel.",
            "best_for": [
                "Individuals who prefer high-carbohydrate food patterns",
                "Athletes in sports requiring glycogen-heavy performance (endurance, HIIT)",
                "People who struggle with calorie control when consuming high-fat foods",
                "Those with cardiovascular risk factors who benefit from reduced saturated fat"
            ],
            "why_it_works": "Fat is energy-dense (9 kcal/g). Lowering fat intake reduces calorie density of meals, improving satiety per calorie. Carbohydrates support glycogen replenishment and training output, while protein preserves lean body mass."

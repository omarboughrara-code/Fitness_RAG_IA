    "goal": "Support muscle hypertrophy while controlling fat gain by emphasizing higher dietary fats and moderate carbohydrates",
    "approach": "Moderate caloric surplus (10\u201315%) with 35\u201340% of calories from fat and carbs at 3\u20134 g/kg/day",
    "best_for": [
      "Individuals prone to fat gain on high-carb bulks",
      "Endomorph body types or those with lower carbohydrate tolerance",
      "Athletes in sports or phases where glycogen demand is moderate (e.g., strength-focused blocks)"
    ],
    "scientific_basis": [
      "Higher fat intake maintains anabolic hormones like testosterone",
      "Provides calorie density for appetite control",
